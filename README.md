# Analysing the RNA-Loops database

This project analyses the [RNALoops Database](https://rnaloops.cs.put.poznan.pl/) to verify data integrity and get insights to the distribution of RNA structures stored there. 

Basic studies include the identification of issues in data quality:

Furthermore, clusters of structures are analysed in depth to get a full understanding of similarities and differences in the structural and biological properties of various RNA multiloops:

Finally the angles between helices of the structures are predicted using a deep neural network:
